Grain size and shape are important components of grain yield and quality and have been under selection since cereals were first domesticated. Here, we show that a quantitative trait locus _**GW8**_ is synonymous with _OsSPL16_, which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of cell proliferation. Higher expression of this gene promotes cell division and grain filling, with positive consequences for grain width and yield in rice. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in Basmati rice is associated with the formation of a more slender grain and better quality of appearance. The correlation between grain size and allelic variation at the _GW8_ locus suggests that mutations within the promoter region were likely selected in rice breeding programs. We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of _GS3_ and _OsSPL16_ underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield.

谷粒大小与形状是大米产量与质量的重要因素，自谷类驯化始起就一直处于育种选择压之下。在此，我们表明一个QTL，GW8，与OsSPL6同义，编码一种细胞增殖正调因子。此基因的高度表达促使细胞分裂与灌浆，与谷粒宽度和水稻产量正相关。相反，在Basmati水稻突变体中，此基因的功能缺失导致谷粒更为细长，以及更好的表观品质。谷粒大小与GW8位点处等位基因变异的相关性表明，启动子区的突变很可能是在水稻育种过程中所选择。同时，我们也表明，导向影响谷粒大小与形状的GS3与OsSPL6优良等位基因的标记辅助育种可以有效地应用于**同时改善水稻质量与产量**。
