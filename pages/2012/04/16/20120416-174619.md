# A review of puffing process for expansion of biological products

**A review of puffing processes for expansion of biological products**

F.A. Payne, J.L. Taraba, D. Saputra

Journal of Food Engineering, 1989, 10: 183-197

A research objective to develop a puffing process which would improve the rehydration characteristics of air-dried fruits and vegetables led to a review of puffing processes described in the US patent and published literature. The puffing processes found were classified into four categories based on the method responsible for gas evolution: phase change, absorption, adsorption, and chemical reaction. An explosive expansion rate E was calculated for different puffing processes in each category. It appears that E must be in the range 0.05-12m3/s*kg to puff biological products
