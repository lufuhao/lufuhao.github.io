Dear Sarah, 

I'm not sure if you'll get this. I don't know if I'm only good at painting these pictures, but I am trying. In this picture there is a river and there is a horse, and there is a man sitting that horse, and all these things are in the Foothills...And when this man closes his eyes, he can see a woman kissing him as like as to smother him. And this man knows that kings may die and countries may crumble, but if people look close enough, they just might, as I have, Sarah, they just might find something to believe in. I have to go now, but before I do, remember that rules: Don't Die!
