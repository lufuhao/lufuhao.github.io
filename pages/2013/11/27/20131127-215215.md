# Run a cluster job with graphical interface

> 2013/11/27 21:52:15

Recently I need to run some jobs but with graphical interface. In short, you need a X-server under Windows if you have not  got any. Or you may need to ass the –X behind ssh, like “ssh –X host”

 

## 1. Windows: 

 

### 1.1. install Xming

download Xming and Xming-fonts from <http://sourceforge.net/projects/xming/>

![20131127-215215-0002](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0002.png)

After the install finished, run XLaunch to configure Xming X server. Good to use the default setting

Display 代表一套 I/O 设备，包括显示、鼠标、键盘；Display Number 就是这套 I/O 设备的代号；同时 Display Number 还决定了 Xming X server 的 TCP 端口，端口号为 6000 + Display Number。Linux 主机上的应用程序通过此端口建立与 Xming X server 的连接。

**important: Remember this DISPLAY NUMBER, and later we will use that.**

![20131127-215215-0005](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0005.png)

![20131127-215215-0006](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0006.png)

Save the configuration into .xlaunch file. Double click this .xlaunch file would start the Xserver service. You may find the Xming icon on the task bar.

 

### 1.2. Config your Putty

![20131127-215215-0007](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0007.png)

Fill the host you want to connect to. Connection type: ssh

![20131127-215215-0008](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0008.png)

[Optional] Fill in your auto-login username. If not, it will promote the username when you try to connect.

![20131127-215215-0009](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0009.png)

Check “Enable X11 forwarding”, and fill in the X display location with **localhost:Display_number**. the display number would be the number you setup in Xming as described above. By default, it should be “localhost:0”

![20131127-215215-0010](/assets/images/20131127-215215-0010.png)

[Ignore this if you want to set up again each time when you connect to the host] You may save you Putty setting by going back to the session part. Input a name under the “Saved Sessions”and click save. Next time, click the saved setting, and then load. Enjoy…

 

## 2. Linux 

Under Linux, you may need some parameter behind ssh to enable the X-server/Xorg-like display service when you ssh to the host. For me, under linux workstation (CentOS 6.4), just one simple command: 

> ssh –X host.address

Hope this would be helpful.
