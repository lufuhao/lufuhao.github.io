**How to resuspend primers**

* Centrifuge tube for 1 min at maximum speed 

* Add sterile 1× TE Buffer (pH7.5-8.0) or H2O to make up to 100 µM 

* Vortex, then keep on ice for 10 min 

* Vortex again, then spin quickly to clean lid, keep at -20℃ 

* Make appropriate dilutions from this master stock.
