## ABSTRACT

Grain size and shape are important components of grain yield and quality and have been under selection since cereals were first domesticated. Here, we show that a quantitative trait locus _**GW8**_ is synonymous with _OsSPL16_, which encodes a protein that is a positive regulator of cell proliferation. Higher expression of this gene promotes cell division and grain filling, with positive consequences for grain width and yield in rice. Conversely, a loss-of-function mutation in Basmati rice is associated with the formation of a more slender grain and better quality of appearance. The correlation between grain size and allelic variation at the _GW8_ locus suggests that mutations within the promoter region were likely selected in rice breeding programs. We also show that a marker-assisted strategy targeted at elite alleles of _GS3_ and _OsSPL16_ underlying grain size and shape can be effectively used to simultaneously improve grain quality and yield.

谷粒大小与形状是大米产量与质量的重要因素，自谷类驯化始起就一直处于育种选择压之下。在此，我们表明一个QTL，GW8，与OsSPL6同义，编码一种细胞增殖正调因子。此基因的高度表达促使细胞分裂与灌浆，与谷粒宽度和水稻产量正相关。相反，在Basmati水稻突变体中，此基因的功能缺失导致谷粒更为细长，以及更好的表观品质。谷粒大小与GW8位点处等位基因变异的相关性表明，启动子区的突变很可能是在水稻育种过程中所选择。同时，我们也表明，导向影响谷粒大小与形状的GS3与OsSPL6优良等位基因的标记辅助育种可以有效地应用于**同时改善水稻质量与产量**。   Endnote citation/引文: [riceOsSPL16.ris](http://bs.baidu.com/p-59c9636845cc059937db28345f43c76a/719597a260e8b476d3e2d5273de9eb43?sign=MBOT:gNQ17x3aoMs8:es8A1z4gn6Vw80b5tH8eXx4pSss%3D&time=1340758251&response-content-disposition=attachment;%20filename=riceOsSPL16.ris&response-cache-control=private) PDF document/文档 [Control of grain size, shape and quality by OsSPL16 in rice.PDF](http://bs.baidu.com/p-59c9636845cc059937db28345f43c76a/04db294c8c0535cad1fa373e57b9ceb6?sign=MBOT:gNQ17x3aoMs8:jXTRVVOQ95d209UMrMM%2F560ekNo%3D&time=1340758251&response-content-disposition=attachment;%20filename=Control%20of%20grain%20size%2C%20shape%20and%20quality%20by%20OsSPL16%20in%20rice.PDF&response-cache-control=private) Supplementary file/附加材料 [ng.2327-S1.pdf](http://bs.baidu.com/p-59c9636845cc059937db28345f43c76a/5242e2350d0c9bded98db3f1d37bdb85?sign=MBOT:gNQ17x3aoMs8:CJpozI6fkG3A%2FG0Q%2FusZCwm4VT8%3D&time=1340758251&response-content-disposition=attachment;%20filename=ng.2327-S1.pdf&response-cache-control=private)
