### Abstract (provisional)

#### Background

The AthaMap database generates a genome-wide map for putative transcription factor binding sites for _A. thaliana_. When analyzing transcriptional regulation using AthaMap it may be important to learn which genes are also post-transcriptionally regulated by inhibitory RNAs. Therefore, a unified database for transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation will be highly useful for the analysis of gene expression regulation.

#### Methods

To identify putative microRNA target sites in the genome of _A. thaliana_, **processed mature miRNAs from 243 annotated miRNA genes** were used for screening with the psRNATarget web server. Positional information, target genes and the psRNATarget score for each target site were annotated to the AthaMap database. Furthermore, putative target sites for small RNAs from seven small RNA transcriptome datasets were used to determine small RNA target sites within the _A. thaliana_ genome.

#### Results

Putative 41,965 genome wide miRNA target sites and 10,442 miRNA target genes were identified in the _A. thaliana_ genome. Taken together with genes targeted by small RNAs from small RNA transcriptome datasets, a total of 16,600 _A. thaliana_ genes are putatively regulated by inhibitory RNAs. A novel web-tool, 'MicroRNA Targets', was integrated into AthaMap which permits the identification of genes predicted to be regulated by selected miRNAs. The predicted target genes are displayed with positional information and the psRNATarget score of the target site. Furthermore, putative target sites of small RNAs from selected tissue datasets can be identified with the new 'Small RNA Targets' web-tool.

#### Conclusions

The integration of predicted miRNA and small RNA target sites with transcription factor binding sites will be useful for AthaMap-assisted gene expression analysis. URL: <http://www.athamap.de/>
