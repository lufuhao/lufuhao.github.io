# 不需考GRE的美国学校列表

In this article I have listed universities where **GRE is not required **for graduate school admission. Following the [Average GRE Scores for Universities](http://www.happyschoolsblog.com/average-gre-scoreuniversities/), I’m collecting information about Universities where GRE Score is not required for admission. There are many universities where students can get admission to Masters Degree program without GRE Scores. 

Some department within the university will require GRE score, but for some departments GRE Score is not required. I will try to list the specific department like computer science, electrical engineering, biotechnology, civil, mechanical, industrial engineering and other programs along with university name where Standard Admission test scores are not required for graduate school application.

If you know other schools or looking for specif degree programs that accept students without GRE Score, post a comment with name of the programs. 

GRE Score for Visa Interview 

Even though at few schools where GRE is not required, but during student visa interview, visa officer might ask for GRE score. So, its strongly advisable to take GRE and TOEFL exam. Most of the comments Happy Schools Blog get is about university suggestions. And I always suggest to get GRE Score above 1000 for some departments and and 1100 for most of engineering majors.
